# Tasks
# Create a graph G where each vertex represents a wrestler and each edge represents a rivalry. The graph will contain n vertices and r edges. 
# Perform as many BFSâ€™s as needed to visit all vertices. 
# Assign all wrestlers whose distance is even to be babyfaces and all wrestlers whose distance is odd to be heels. 
# Then check each edge to verify that it goes between a babyface and a heel.
