# How To Compile/Run Code

## Question 4/5a/EC
Ensure data.txt is in the same directory as Python script for mergesort.py & insertsort.py

Run in terminal
4
> python mergesort.py
> 
> python insertsort.py
>

5a and EC do not require data.txt to be in the same directory. Their inputs are included in the file and require manual manipulation for the variables used as inputs.

5a
> python mergeTime.py
> 
> python insertTime.py

EC
> python mergeTimeBestWorst.py
> 
> python insertTimeBestWorst.py
